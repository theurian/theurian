# Changelog — Theurian Core

All notable changes to the **`theurian` Python package** are documented here.
The Claude Code plugin has its own changelog at
[`plugins/claude-code/CHANGELOG.md`](../../plugins/claude-code/CHANGELOG.md);
the two version and release independently (ADR-0001).

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Pre-1.0, a MINOR bump may change the protocol. Post-1.0, only a MAJOR may.

## [Unreleased]

Milestone 0 — architecture and OSS foundation.

### Added

- **Domain model.** Immutable `KnowledgeRevision` under a mutable
  `KnowledgeItem` pointer; typed relations, aliases, source anchors, and
  evidence; specifications with their structured form preserved; traceability
  edges and per-change-type policy; review events, threads, comments,
  resolutions, promotion gates, and knowledge candidates.
- **Ten enforced invariants**, including content-hash verification, immutable
  revisions, half-open validity windows, and mandatory source attribution.
- **Fourteen ports** as `Protocol`s, including `Clock` and `IdGenerator` — both
  ports because time and identifiers are inputs to the state hash, and without
  controlling them the reproducibility guarantee is not assertable.
- **Scope isolation primitives.** A RAPTOR tree's identity is
  `(project, tenant, sensitivity, acl_group, namespace)`, so a summary spanning
  two sensitivity levels has no tree to belong to.
- **Path containment and input limits.** `realpath` resolution before
  containment checks, symlink-escape rejection on intermediate components as
  well as final targets, size and depth caps, and permission checks for
  credential files.
- **Compatibility resolution**, including SemVer §11 ordering and a PEP 440 →
  SemVer translation so Core's own development versions resolve correctly.
- **CLI**: `theurian version --json` and `theurian compat check`, with exit code
  3 reserved for a compatibility mismatch.
- **Public JSON Schemas** for the migration format, MCP tool context, retrieval
  results, project configuration, the CLI version contract, and plugin
  compatibility metadata.
- **275 tests** covering domain invariants, layering, scope isolation, path
  security, schemas, the plugin boundary, and the CLI contract. All run offline.

### Security

- Retrieval results are structurally prevented from being marked executable.
- Every result requires at least one source anchor.
- Migration `contentFile` paths are rejected at both schema and runtime level if
  they escape the project root.
